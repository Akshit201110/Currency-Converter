# Currency Converter
This project is a Python-based Currency Converter developed to demonstrate effective data handling, real-time value processing, and modular programming techniques.

Key Features:

Data Handling:
The application retrieves and processes currency exchange rates, either from a predefined dataset or through live API calls (if used). It ensures accurate currency conversion by handling numerical data precisely and validating user inputs to prevent errors.

Real-Time Conversion:
The user can input the amount, select source and target currencies, and receive instant conversion results. The program manages dynamic data (live rates) and static data (fixed rates) efficiently, depending on the implementation.

User Interaction:
Designed with a simple and intuitive interface, the converter takes user inputs, performs calculations based on the latest exchange rates, and displays the output clearly. Input validation and exception handling ensure a smooth user experience.

Scalability and Extensibility:
The project structure allows easy enhancements such as integrating live exchange rate APIs, adding support for more currencies, implementing historical rate tracking, or building a GUI for a better user interface.
